# Comment Box Exercise

This comment box tutorial for React.js

## Initial Impressions

* I wish JSX did not require every tag to be closed.
* Why ref attributes on input elements instead of using name?
* One way data flow was a little more work but really easy to understand. I like it for sure.
* The component classes are very easy to understand.
* Component architecture is also very clear.
* I wonder how React.render would look on a larger app with say 5-10 parent components ...
* Definitely worth further exploration!
